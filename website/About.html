            <h2>Welcome to Project Finder</h2>
            <p>
                Project Finder is designed to help developers of all skill levels find the perfect project ideas based on their current expertise and interests. Whether you're a beginner looking to build your first project or an experienced coder searching for something challenging and exciting, we provide a personalized recommendation system that suggests projects tailored to your skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                We understand how difficult it can be to decide what to build next—especially when you’re trying to improve your skills or create an impressive portfolio. That’s why our platform simplifies the process. Just select the technologies you know (or want to learn), and we will instantly suggest projects categorized by difficulty level, from beginner-friendly apps to advanced real-world implementations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our mission is to make learning through projects easier, more engaging, and highly practical. Instead of just going through endless tutorials, we believe in the "learn by doing" approach. By working on hands-on projects, you not only enhance your technical skills but also gain real-world experience that prepares you for job opportunities, hackathons, and freelance work.
